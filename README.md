# Honest Prompts — Curated, Raw, Unfiltered and Brutally Honest AI Prompts

Welcome — and thank you for being here early.

This repo is a curated set of prompts we’re testing with our earliest supporters (that’s you).  
The goal? Create a tool that gives you **real answers** — not sugar-coated fluff.

These prompts are designed to:
- Reflect uncomfortable truths
- Break mental autopilot
- Hit harder than typical AI tools
- Help you see what you might be avoiding

## 🙌 Why This Exists

Most AI tools tell you what you want to hear.  
We’re building something that tells you what you *need* to hear.

This project is powered by **early waitlist feedback** and built transparently — in public — with you.
